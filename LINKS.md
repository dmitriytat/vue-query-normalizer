# Query String Parameter Handling
Prefacing this with what a [Query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) is:

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript) Stack Overflow answer gives a few basic ways to get and use query parameters.

Looking at the [Vue Docs](https://router.vuejs.org/api/#the-route-object) it offers the Route Object, from which you can also get query parameters. There is another [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43961260/4922810) that gives a demonstration of using it, along with an explanation in the comments.

UTM tags/codes are basically just another query paramter that get tacked on but dealt with elsewhere (often in an analytics platform, like Google Analytics). [Here](https://buffer.com/library/utm-guide) is an explanation of them, and [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en) is specfic usage in Google Analytics.

If you don't need to use one, it can be safely ignored.
